# GeneticAlgorithm
Using Python to make a Genetic Algorithm. 

This a an object to easily create Genetic Algorithm in python. 
It create you several list of your data (everything you want, from number, to string, or any object), you implement your own Ranking process, according to the population, and it create for you the next optimized generation.  

A lot of easy parameters (PopulationSize, EliteSize, MutationRate, LogMessage, Save&amp;LoadGeneration) 
Help me to improve this project or is it and share me your project !!! 
Enjoy it

# Look for
Look for the ExampleCharacter.py and ExampleNumber.py to see how to use the GeneticObject.py

Startup :
from GeneticObject import Genetic
